### Parental Controls, block evil/toxic content websites notes:
* hosts does not block subdomains, so you need to include them as well. i.e. if only google.com is blocked; translate.google.com will still work.
* when you add new data, combine it with existing ones, then use vim [sort u].
* sudo vim /etc/hosts

### Sources:
* https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/porn/hosts _combine it with [StevenBlack_PornAndAllLists]_
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/social/hosts _extract what you need and separate into filed (e.g. [Custom09Instagram], [Custom10Linkedin].. etc.)_

### Notes:
* To block websites based on specific keywords, use e2guardian as a transparent proxy (https://github.com/elyoas/firewall_e2guardian) and use the following regular expression blocking list with it: (https://github.com/elyoas/Regular-expressions-to-block-pornography)
* see iptables (firewall filtering)
* It is possible to use DNS filtering instead of the hosts file. OpenDNS used to provide this for free. It is possible to run own DNS server
